# Async Up Bank API

This project is a async fork of jcwillox/up-bank-api. I've attempted to keep most things the same but I have changed a fair bit.

If there's any issues please let me know.

This is an unofficial python wrapper (client) for the australian bank Up's API.

## Usage

The code is fully typed and documented so I'd recommend just having a look at the code, or letting syntax completion take the wheel.

To use this library you will need a personal access token which can be retrieved from https://developer.up.com.au. When using this library you can either provide the token directly or use the environment variable `UP_TOKEN`.
